# Step 0001: create react app

Use yarn create react-app to create application with a simple functional component.

## Create app

Run: `yarn create react-app step006_client_get_server_data`

`cd step006_client_get_server_data`

Run `npm install`

Run `npm install axios --save`

Rewrite app as class based component. Implement axios example. Go to step005 server location debug mode, run "Launch Server" to start server.

Run `npm start`

You can see the client talk to server and update page.
